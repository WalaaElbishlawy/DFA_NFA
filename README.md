TOC-DFA-NFA Assignment
Overview
This repository contains solutions for the assignment related to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). The assignment involves solving 10 problems using Java and includes tasks such as drawing automata, simulating DFA, and processing input and output files.

Requirements
Solve all 10 problems using Java.
The Java program should read from one input text file and produce one output text file.
Submit drawings of all DFAs and NFAs in a separate PDF file.
Input File Format
The input file should follow this format:

Problem Number: The number of the problem to be solved.
Input Values: Values required for the problem.
End Indicator: Use the word end to indicate the end of input for the current problem and to move to the next problem.
Output File Format
The output file should follow this format:

Problem Number: The number of the problem.
Output Values: Corresponding output values of the input for the problem.
End Indicator: Use the character x to indicate the end of output for the current problem and to move to the next problem.
DFA Simulation
For the DFA-related problems, your Java program should simulate the DFA with the following details:

States: Define all states of the DFA.
Alphabet: Specify the alphabet of the DFA.
Transition Function: Describe the transition function of the DFA.
Start State: Indicate the start state of the DFA.
Accepting States: List all accepting states.
NFA Simulation
For the NFA-related problems, your Java program should simulate the NFA with similar details as DFA, but considering the non-deterministic aspects.
